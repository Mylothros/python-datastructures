# Data Structures in Python

This repository contains Python implementations of various data structures. Each data structure is implemented in a separate module, providing a clear and organized way to understand and use them.

## Available Data Structures

1. Binary Search Tree (`binarysearchtree.py`):
   - A binary search tree is a hierarchical data structure that allows efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations.
   - Key operations: insert, delete, search, inorder traversal.

2. Circular Linked List (`circularlinkedlist.py`):
   - A circular linked list is a variation of the linked list in which the last node points back to the first node, creating a circular structure.
   - Key operations: insert, delete, traverse.

3. Dictionaries (`dicts.py`):
   - Dictionaries are key-value pairs that provide a way to store and retrieve data based on unique keys.
   - Key operations: insert, delete, search.

4. Doubly Linked List (`doublylinkedlist.py`):
   - A doubly linked list is a linked list in which each node contains references to both the previous and next nodes.
   - Key operations: insert, delete, traverse.

5. Linked List (`linkedlist.py`):
   - A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains a reference to the next node.
   - Key operations: insert, delete, traverse.

6. List (`list.py`):
   - A list is a built-in data structure in Python that allows storing multiple items in a single variable.
   - Key operations: append, remove, access by index.

7. Max Heap (`maxheap.py`):
   - A max heap is a complete binary tree where the value of each node is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
   - Key operations: insert, delete_max, get_max.

8. Queues (`queues.py`):
   - Queues follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle and allow efficient insertion and removal.
   - Key operations: enqueue, dequeue, peek.

9. Sets (`sets.py`):
   - Sets are unordered collections of unique elements that support mathematical set operations.
   - Key operations: add, remove, intersection, union.

10. Stacks (`stacks.py`):
    - Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, allowing efficient insertion and removal at the top.
    - Key operations: push, pop, peek.

11. Tuples (`tuples.py`):
    - Tuples are immutable sequences that can store a collection of elements of different types.
    - Key operations: access by index, unpacking.
